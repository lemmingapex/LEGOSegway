This is my first Exploration into PID Controllers.  Using LEGO Mindstroms ev3 brick, I built a simple 'segway'.  

lego_segway.ev3 is a program to balence a LEGO segway.

Inputs:  gyroscope angle and rate, motor encoders angle and rate
Output:  motor torque

I will provide a link to the code if anyone shows interest.
